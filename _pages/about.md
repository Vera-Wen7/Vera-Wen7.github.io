Welcome to my website! 

I am currently a graduate student in Algebraic Geometry at Sun Yat-sen University. My research interest include toric geometry and positivity of linear series. I aim to pursue a career in academia, contributing to the field of mathematics.

Beyond mathematics, I have diverse interests, including sports, travel, and computer technology. I am a curious individual with a strong desire to explore new things and expand my horizons. On this website, I hope to share not only my mathematical research and ideas but also the wonderful moments and experiences life has to offer.
