We demonstrate that a lattice simplex in dimension 3 (resp. 4) with lattice length of at least 2 (resp. 3 and no edge has lattice length 5) can be covered by dilated simplices of the form sQ, where integer s≥2 (resp. 3) and Q is a lattice simplex. The covering property implies these simplices are integrally closed. As an application, we obtain a simple criterion for the projective normality of ample line bundles on 3-(resp. 4-) dimensional Q-factorial toric Fano varieties with Picard number one. Along the way, we discover certain unexpected phenomenon"}],"awards":[{"title":"Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) – Honorable Mention,","date":"2022","awarder":"Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP)","url":"https://www.comap.com/contests/mcm-icm","summary":"Awarded for outstanding performance in solving a real-world mathematical modeling problem as part of a three-person team in an international modeling competition.
