We demonstrate that a lattice simplex in dimension 3 (resp. 4) with lattice length of at least 2 (resp. 3 and no edge has lattice length 5) can be covered by dilated simplices of the form sQ, where integer s≥2 (resp. 3) and Q is a lattice simplex. The covering property implies these simplices are integrally closed. As an application, we obtain a simple criterion for the projective normality of ample line bundles on 3-(resp. 4-) dimensional Q-factorial toric Fano varieties with Picard number one. Along the way, we discover certain unexpected phenomenon"}],"skills":[{"name":"Mathematics","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Algebraic Geometry","Toric Geometry"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Chinese","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Physics","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}]}
